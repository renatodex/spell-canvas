{"name":"Spell Canvas","body":"### Introduction\r\nEveryone talk about Canvas. Canvas this, Canvas that, the new Flash, etc, etc, etc.\r\nBut...it is really easy to use? Not really, yet.\r\nBuild Canvas apps today is a CRAP. Theres a whole work you have to do before your project is ready to start.\r\nI built this framework to easy your life. Correction: To easy my life. But im sure it can works for you too.\r\n\r\n### How to start?\r\nIts so easy to start using Spell-Canvas, all you need to do is clone the repository and setup your page to load it.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:renatodex/spell-canvas.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n### But how it works?\r\nSpell is based on Stages (or Pages), like Scenes on Adobe Flash. All you need to do is create a new page based on the Project structure and start to work.\r\n\r\nIf you had a site made in canvas, you would create a Stage for each link you have. (Home, Services, Contact, etc)\r\n\r\nThe structure of a page is as follow:\r\n```\r\ndefine(['pages', 'draw'], function(Page, Draw) {\r\n    return Page.extend({      \r\n        init : function() {\r\n            console.log('My page!');\r\n        },\r\n    });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nEverytime you change the page, the Canvas is re-drawed.\r\n\r\n### I should use it?\r\nI do not recommend Spell for production environment yet, because its still at development stage.\r\nBut feel free to study the source code and see if you can contribute.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAt least only me (@renatodex). If you want to contribute, talk to me!\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with something? Dont worry, this is not a documentation, and my support not the best for now, but im just implementing new things like Events, Animation, so, keep an eye open!","tagline":"A framework built on top of cool libraries which allows you to have a Canvas Application all ready to play.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
