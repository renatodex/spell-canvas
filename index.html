        <h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Everyone talk about Canvas. Canvas this, Canvas that, the new Flash, etc, etc, etc.
But...it is really easy to use? Not really, yet.
Build Canvas apps today is a CRAP. Theres a whole work you have to do before your project is ready to start.
I built this framework to easy your life. Correction: To easy my life. But im sure it can works for you too.</p>

<h3>How to start?</h3>

<p>Its so easy to start using Spell-Canvas, all you need to do is clone the repository and setup your page to load it.</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone git@github.com:renatodex/spell-canvas.git
</code></pre>

<h3>But how it works?</h3>

<p>Spell is based on Stages (or Pages), like Scenes on Adobe Flash. All you need to do is create a new page based on the Project structure and start to work.</p>

<p>If you had a site made in canvas, you would create a Stage for each link you have. (Home, Services, Contact, etc)</p>

<p>The structure of a page is as follow:</p>

<pre><code>define(['pages', 'draw'], function(Page, Draw) {
    return Page.extend({      
        init : function() {
            console.log('My page!');
        },
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Everytime you change the page, the Canvas is re-drawed.</p>

<h3>I should use it?</h3>

<p>I do not recommend Spell for production environment yet, because its still at development stage.
But feel free to study the source code and see if you can contribute.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>At least only me (<a href="https://github.com/renatodex" class="user-mention">@renatodex</a>). If you want to contribute, talk to me!</p>

<h3>Support or Contact</h3>

<p>Having trouble with something? Dont worry, this is not a documentation, and my support not the best for now, but im just implementing new things like Events, Animation, so, keep an eye open!</p>
